# üö® URGENT: ANDROID TEAM - FIX YOUR URL GENERATION

## **CURRENT PROBLEM**

**You are generating WRONG URLs like this:**
```
http://localhost:3000/routes/road-disruption/[a3203]-lambeth-bridge-(se1-,sw1p-)-(lambeth,westminster)-TIMS-204461
```

**This is WRONG because you're using `road_description` field!**

## **CORRECT SOLUTION**

**You should generate CLEAN URLs like this:**
```
http://localhost:3000/routes/road-disruption/southern-river-route-TIMS-204461
```

## **API DATA STRUCTURE**

```json
{
  "road_name": "southern river route",           // ‚Üê USE THIS FIELD
  "road_description": "[A3203] LAMBETH BRIDGE (SE1 ,SW1P ) (Lambeth,Westminster)", // ‚Üê DON'T USE THIS FIELD
  "disruption_id": "TIMS-204461"
}
```

## **FIX YOUR CODE**

### **‚ùå WRONG (Current Implementation):**
```kotlin
val streetName = disruptionData.road_description  // DON'T DO THIS!
```

### **‚úÖ CORRECT (Fixed Implementation):**
```kotlin
val streetName = disruptionData.road_name  // DO THIS!
```

## **COMPLETE FIXED CODE**

```kotlin
fun generateRoadDisruptionUrl(streetName: String, disruptionId: String): String {
    val slug = "${streetName.lowercase().replace(" ", "-")}-$disruptionId"
    return "$baseUrl/routes/road-disruption/$slug"
}

// In your share button:
val streetName = disruptionData.road_name ?: "Unknown Street"  // ‚Üê USE road_name
val disruptionId = disruptionData.disruption_id ?: "unknown"
val shareUrl = generateRoadDisruptionUrl(streetName, disruptionId)
```

## **RESULT**

**Before (WRONG):**
```
http://localhost:3000/routes/road-disruption/[a3203]-lambeth-bridge-(se1-,sw1p-)-(lambeth,westminster)-TIMS-204461
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```
http://localhost:3000/routes/road-disruption/southern-river-route-TIMS-204461
```

## **ACTION REQUIRED**

1. **Change your code** to use `road_name` instead of `road_description`
2. **Test the URLs** to make sure they're clean
3. **Deploy the fix** immediately

## **BOSS'S FINAL WORD**

**Use ONLY the `road_name` field. No exceptions. No technical details. Clean URLs only.**

**Fix this now!** üöÄ
